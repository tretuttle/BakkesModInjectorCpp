# Memories and Decision Log for BakkesMod Injector Improvements

This file serves as a persistent memory for the project, recording important decisions, learnings, and context to ensure continuity across sessions and workstations.

Each entry includes:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., M001).
- **Date**: When the memory was recorded.
- **Description**: Details of the decision or learning.

## Memories

| ID | Date | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| M001 | [Current Date] | User prefers that the assistant verify terminal command outputs and wait long enough to see errors before proceeding. (Imported from session memory ID: 563631) |
| M002 | [Current Date] | The user prefers the assistant to avoid making assumptions during investigations or problem-solving. Focus on what is actually known. When unclear, ask clarifying questions instead of inferring details. (Imported from session memory ID: 563635) |
| M003 | [Current Date] | Project must be agnostic to AI models, IDEs, etc., emphasizing git-based tracking for portability. |
| M004 | [Current Date] | Project goal expanded to revamp entire BakkesMod user experience from end user perspective. This may require changes across multiple repositories as BakkesMod is not a monorepo. Current pain points: outdated UI, plugin manager needs redesign, uncertainty about component distribution across repos. |

Add new entries as decisions are made or new context is gained.
